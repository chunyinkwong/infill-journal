Research: 1 hour (brainstorming + printer type researching)

Brainstorming ideas, first draft idea selected: A foldable 3D printer that is able to be stored within an small apartment.

**Draft specifications**
-  Should fold flat so it can be stored nearly flush to the wall
-  Be easily unfoldable without any tools
-  Have a heated bed
-  Be able to print PLA
-  Moderate speed (50-150mm/s)

**TBD, in progress**

Printer type:
- CoreXY
  - **Pros**
    - Fast print speed
  - **Cons**
    - Has a belt which might be hard to tension after folding and unfolding
- Cantilever
  - **Pros**
    - Compact
  - **Cons**
    - Stability issues
- Rectilinear
