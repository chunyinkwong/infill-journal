Total hours so far: 8

- [x] I have access to 3D printing facilities and am able to obtain printed models on or before March 21st.

Research: 1 hour (brainstorming + printer type researching)

Brainstorming ideas, first draft idea selected: A foldable 3D printer that is able to be stored within an small apartment.

**Draft specifications**
-  Should fold flat so it can be stored nearly flush to the wall
-  Be easily unfoldable without any tools
-  Have a heated bed
-  Be able to print PLA
-  Moderate speed (50-150mm/s)

**TBD, in progress**

Printer type:
- CoreXY
  - **Pros**
    - Fast print speed
  - **Cons**
    - Has a belt which might be hard to tension after folding and unfolding
- Cantilever
  - **Pros**
    - Compact
  - **Cons**
    - Stability issues
- Rectilinear

CAD: 1 hour

Installed Fusion360 and watched some tutorials on how to use CAD software

## 12th March 2025

Spent 2.5 hours trying to CAD a toolhead, realized that I have no clue that I am doing.

Probably should've started on the gantry and frame first. This plan only took 30 mins and it's more progress that I've made on the toolhead

**Frame plan**

Bed slinger 3D printer design

![pro drawing in paint](https://files.catbox.moe/vfhj1d.png)

- Part circled in red should have some joint that allows it to fold
- The top of the frame will move along the blue arrow
- Ensure it actually folds flat given that the user manually moves the hotend to the top and the bed to one side after power off
- When opened, it shoud be locked into place and a stopper or something that ensures it is square
    - Perhaps some spring locking mechanisms but I don't know how any of that would work
- To close it, probably will be some button or something to hold down
  - Probably should lock in place when shut as well
 
btw no clue how to design any of that in CAD brb gonna spend 6 hours later learning Fusion360

## 14th March 2025

Spent 3 hours learning Fusion360 again
